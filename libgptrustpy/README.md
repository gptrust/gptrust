¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ? Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans
<|°_°|> This quote, often attributed to John Lennon, means that while
  we may have plans and goals for our lives, life itself has a way of
  unfolding in unexpected ways. It serves as a reminder to be present
  and adaptable, and to not become too attached to our plans. Instead,
  we should appreciate and embrace the journey that life takes us on,
  as it is often full of surprises, lessons, and joys that we never
  could have anticipated.
```

```
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ? Everything you've ever wanted is on the other side of fear.
<|°_°|> This quote encourages people to overcome their fears in order to
  achieve their goals and desires. Fear often prevents us from taking
  risks or pursuing opportunities, but it is essential to confront and
  conquer them in order to grow, learn, and ultimately succeed. By pushing
  through fear, we can discover new experiences, skills, and a deeper
  understanding of ourselves and the world around us. In other words, fear
  limits us; facing it allows us to reach our full potential.
